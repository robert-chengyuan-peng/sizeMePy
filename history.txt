What did I do -





Created appengine_config.py
- from google.appengine.ext import vendor

vendor.add('lib')

Vendor lib adds libraries installed into lib folder


Created requirements.txt in Root
- Created install config for Flask and Werkzeug as WSGIs (webservice gateway interface)


Removed install config for werkzeug and flask

added install config for webapp2 and jinja
